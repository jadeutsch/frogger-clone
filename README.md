### How to Play

When the game loads on the webpage, you'll see a character standing at the bottom 
of a 2x5 area of grass. Just above that is a 3x5 area of stone with bugs traveling
at various speeds from left to right. A blue gem sits in the center of the stone area
with a 2x5 area of water just beyond the stone. To win, you must move the character
from the grass, using the Up-Down-Left-Right arrow keys, across the stone without 
colliding with the bugs, and onto the water. Collecting the gem adds an additional 
100 points to your score. If you collide with an enemy bug, you will restart back 
on the grass. Once you get to the water, with or without collecting the gem, the 
game ends and your score is shown. A popup appears asking if you want to play again. 
Pressing the 'Play Again' button, clicking the escape button, or simply clicking outside 
the popup, refreshes the game to begin again.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) 
for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are 
**object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype 
functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used 
appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the 
function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your 
instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
